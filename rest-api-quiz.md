## REST APIs

#### Q1. Which REST constraint essentially prohibits the use of cookies?

- [x] Stateless
- [ ] Cacheable
- [ ] Layered System
- [ ] Uniform Interface

#### Explanation

A REST API is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.

REST Principles:
1. Client-server
2. Stateless
3. Cacheable
4. Uniform interface
5. Layered system
6. Code on demand (optional)

Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. When the client makes an HTTP request, it includes all information necessary for the server to fulfill the request.

The server never relies on information from previous requests from the client.

üéì HTTP cookies (also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies) are small blocks of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on the user's computer or other device by the user's web browser.

#### Q2. Which URL pattern is recommended when working with one resource and a collection of resources?

- [ ] `/companies/{id} and/company`
- [ ] `/company/{id} and/companies`
- [x] `/companies/{id} and/companies`
- [ ] `/company/{id} and/company`

#### Explanation

Having a strong and consistent REST resource naming strategy ‚Äì will prove one of the best design decisions in the long term.

When resources are named well, an API is intuitive and easy to use. If done poorly, that same API can feel difficult to use and understand.

The constraint of a uniform interface is partially addressed by the combination of URIs and HTTP verbs and using them in line with the standards and conventions.

A resource can be‚Ä¶ 
- a singleton;
- a collection.

For example, ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù is a collection resource and ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù is a singleton resource.

We can identify ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù collection resources using the URI:

```
/customers
```

We can identify a single ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù resource using the URI:

```
/customers/{customerId}
```

#### Q3. When dealing with JSON web Tokens (JWTs), what is a claim?

- [x] `data in the token`
- [ ] `Ownership`
- [ ] `a permission`
- [ ] `and integer`

#### Explanation

JSON Web Token is a JSON encoded representation of a claim(s) that can be transferred between two parties. The claim is digitally signed by the issuer of the token, and the party receiving this token can later use this digital signature to prove the ownership of the claim.

Claims constitute the payload part of a JSON web token and represent a set of information exchanged between two parties.

JWTs can be broken down into three parts:

1. Header;
2. Payload;
3. Signature.

Each part is separated from the other by dot (.), and will follow the below structure:

```
Header.Payload.Signature
```

##### 1. Header

The header typically consists of two parts:

1. The type of the token, which is JWT;
2. The signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

For example:

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

Then, this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.

##### 2. Payload

The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.

There are three types of claims:

1. Registered claims,
2. Public claims,
3. Private claims.

An example payload could be:

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```

##### 3. Signature

To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

For example if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

##### 4. Putting all together

The output is three Base64-URL strings separated by dots that can be easily passed in HTML and HTTP environments, while being more compact when compared to XML-based standards such as SAML.

The following shows a JWT that has the previous header and payload encoded, and it is signed with a secret.

#### Q4. Which REST contraint specifies that knowledge and understanding obtained from one component of the API should be generally applicable elsewhere in the API?

- [x] `Uniform Interface`
- [ ] `Client-Server`
- [ ] `Stateless`
- [ ] `Chacheable`

#### Explanation

A REST API is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.

REST Principles:
1. Client-server
2. Stateless
3. Cacheable
4. Uniform interface
5. Layered system
6. Code on demand (optional)

The Uniform Interface constraint defines the interface between clients and servers.

By applying the software engineering principle of generality to the component interface, the overall system architecture is simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved.

In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints are needed to guide the behavior of components. REST is defined by four interface constraints:

1. Identification of resources;
2. Manipulation of resources through representations;
3. Self-descriptive messages;
4. Hypermedia as the engine of application state.

##### 1. Resource-Based

Individual resources are identified in requests using URIs as resource identifiers. The resources themselves are conceptually separate from the representations that are returned to the client.

For example, the server doesn‚Äôt send its database, but rather, some HTML, XML or JSON that represents some database records expressed.

##### 2. Actions on Resources Through Representations

When a client gets a representation of a resource, including any metadata attached, it has enough information to customize or delete the resource on the server, if it has permission to do so.

##### 3. Self-descriptive Messages

Each message includes precise information that describes how to process it. The responses also clearly indicate their cache-ability.

##### 4. Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State

Clients deliver the state via body contents, query-string parameters, request headers and the requested URI.

Services deliver state to clients via body content, response codes, and response headers.

#### Q5. What would you enable to allow a browser on another site to make an AJAX request to your API?

- [ ] `HTTP`
- [ ] `REST`
- [ ] `OPTIONS`
- [x] `CORS`

#### Explanation

AJAX means the interaction between client and server that enables us to partially update our web applications asynchronously.

When the Ajax interaction is complete, JavaScript updates the HTML source of the page so the changes are made immediately without requiring a page refresh.

CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

<img src="./src/rest-api/cors.png" alt="Cross-origin resource" width="500"/>

A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos. Certain "cross-domain" requests, notably Ajax requests, are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy.

CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests.

#### Q6. APIs commonly use webhooks to **\_**.

- [x] `notify other systems of an event`
- [ ] `catch error faster`
- [ ] `improve error logging`
- [ ] `log additional data`

#### Explanation

A Webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information.

A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately.

<img src="./src/rest-api/webhook.png" alt="Webhook"/>

Webhooks are sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúReverse APIs,‚Äù as they give you what amounts to an API spec, and you must design an API for the webhook to use. The webhook will make an HTTP request to your app (typically a POST), and you will then be charged with interpreting it.

##### Consuming a Webhook

The first step in consuming a webhook is giving the webhook provider a URL to deliver requests to. This is most often done through a backend panel or an API. This means that you also need to set up a URL in your app that‚Äôs accessible from the public web.

The majority of webhooks will POST data to you in one of two ways:

1. as JSON or XML to be interpreted,
2. as a form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data).

Your provider will tell you how they deliver it (or even give you a choice in the matter). Both of these are fairly easy to interpret, and most web frameworks will do the work for you. If they don‚Äôt, you may need to call on a function or two.

#### Q7. What is the underlying goal of all APIs?

- [ ] `to add new technologies to an organization's infrastructure.`
- [x] `to share features and functionality with other system.`
- [ ] `to move infrastructure to the cloud.`
- [ ] `to appease the latest digital transformation effort.`

#### Explanation

API is an acronym that stands for ‚Äúapplication programming interface,‚Äù and it allows apps to send information between each other.

While there are numerous protocols and technologies involved, the underlying purpose of APIs is always the same: to let one piece of software communicate with another.

#### Q8. Which is a common command-line tool for using or exploring an API?

- [ ] `bash`
- [x] `curl`
- [ ] `ssh`
- [ ] `powerShell`

#### Explanation

`curl` is a command line tool to transfer data to or from a server, using any of the supported protocols (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, TFTP, TELNET, LDAP or FILE).

This tool is preferred for automation, since it is designed to work without user interaction. curl can transfer multiple files at once.

Syntax:

```
curl [options] [URL...]
```

URL: The most basic use of curl is typing the command followed by the URL.

```
curl https://www.geeksforgeeks.org
```

Example with  ‚Äú-o‚Äù options (saves the downloaded file on the local machine with the name provided in the parameters):

```
curl -o hello.zip ftp://speedtest.tele2.net/1MB.zip
```

#### Q9. What is the modern specification for describing an API?

- [x] `OpenAPI (Swagger)`
- [ ] `WADL`
- [ ] `WSDL`
- [ ] `OAuth`

#### Explanation

The OpenAPI Specification defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.

When The OpenAPI Specification properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

Swagger is a set of rules (in other words, a specification) for a format describing REST APIs. As a result, it can be used to share documentation among product managers, testers and developers, but can also be used by various tools to automate API-related processes

#### Q10. Which HTTP verb is normally used to update or create a resource in an API?

- [ ] `SUBMIT`
- [ ] `WRITE`
- [x] `POST`
- [ ] `CREATE`

#### Explanation

Use `POST` APIs to create new subordinate resources, e.g., a file is subordinate to a directory containing it or a row is subordinate to a database table.

When talking strictly in terms of REST, `POST` methods are used to create a new resource into the collection of resources.

HTTP response code:

1. Response code 201 ‚ÄúCreated‚Äù ‚Äì Ideally is used if a resource has been created on the origin server and contains an entity which describes the status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location header.
2. Response code 200 ‚ÄúOK‚Äù or 204 ‚ÄúNo Content‚Äù is used when the action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can be identified by a URI.
 
‚òùüèº **Important**: Please note that `POST` is neither safe nor idempotent, and invoking two identical POST requests will result in two different resources containing the same information except resource ids.

Example request URIs:

- HTTP POST http://www.appdomain.com/users 
- HTTP POST http://www.appdomain.com/users/123/accounts
