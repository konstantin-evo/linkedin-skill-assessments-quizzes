## REST APIs

#### Q1. Which REST constraint essentially prohibits the use of cookies?

- [x] Stateless
- [ ] Cacheable
- [ ] Layered System
- [ ] Uniform Interface

#### Explanation

A REST API is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.

REST Principles:
1. Client-server
2. Stateless
3. Cacheable
4. Uniform interface
5. Layered system
6. Code on demand (optional)

Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. When the client makes an HTTP request, it includes all information necessary for the server to fulfill the request.

The server never relies on information from previous requests from the client.

üéì HTTP cookies (also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies) are small blocks of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on the user's computer or other device by the user's web browser.

#### Q2. Which URL pattern is recommended when working with one resource and a collection of resources?

- [ ] `/companies/{id} and/company`
- [ ] `/company/{id} and/companies`
- [x] `/companies/{id} and/companies`
- [ ] `/company/{id} and/company`

#### Explanation

Having a strong and consistent REST resource naming strategy ‚Äì will prove one of the best design decisions in the long term.

When resources are named well, an API is intuitive and easy to use. If done poorly, that same API can feel difficult to use and understand.

The constraint of a uniform interface is partially addressed by the combination of URIs and HTTP verbs and using them in line with the standards and conventions.

A resource can be‚Ä¶ 
- a singleton;
- a collection.

For example, ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù is a collection resource and ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù is a singleton resource.

We can identify ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù collection resources using the URI:

```
/customers
```

We can identify a single ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù resource using the URI:

```
/customers/{customerId}
```

#### Q3. When dealing with JSON web Tokens (JWTs), what is a claim?

- [x] `data in the token`
- [ ] `Ownership`
- [ ] `a permission`
- [ ] `and integer`

#### Explanation

JSON Web Token is a JSON encoded representation of a claim(s) that can be transferred between two parties. The claim is digitally signed by the issuer of the token, and the party receiving this token can later use this digital signature to prove the ownership of the claim.

Claims constitute the payload part of a JSON web token and represent a set of information exchanged between two parties.

JWTs can be broken down into three parts:

1. Header;
2. Payload;
3. Signature.

Each part is separated from the other by dot (.), and will follow the below structure:

```
Header.Payload.Signature
```

##### 1. Header

The header typically consists of two parts:

1. The type of the token, which is JWT;
2. The signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

For example:

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

Then, this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.

##### 2. Payload

The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.

There are three types of claims:

1. Registered claims,
2. Public claims,
3. Private claims.

An example payload could be:

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```

##### 3. Signature

To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

For example if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

##### 4. Putting all together

The output is three Base64-URL strings separated by dots that can be easily passed in HTML and HTTP environments, while being more compact when compared to XML-based standards such as SAML.

The following shows a JWT that has the previous header and payload encoded, and it is signed with a secret.
