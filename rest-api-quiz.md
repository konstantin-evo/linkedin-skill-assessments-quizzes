## REST APIs

#### Q1. Which REST constraint essentially prohibits the use of cookies?

- [x] Stateless
- [ ] Cacheable
- [ ] Layered System
- [ ] Uniform Interface

#### Explanation

A REST API is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.

REST Principles:
1. Client-server
2. Stateless
3. Cacheable
4. Uniform interface
5. Layered system
6. Code on demand (optional)

Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. When the client makes an HTTP request, it includes all information necessary for the server to fulfill the request.

The server never relies on information from previous requests from the client.
