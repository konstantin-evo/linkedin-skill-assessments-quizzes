## Spring Framework

#### Q1. How filters are used in Spring Web?

- [x] Filters are called before a request hits the DispatcherServlet.They allow for interception-style, chained processing of web requests for security, timeouts, and other purposes.
- [ ] Filters are used with a checksum algorithm that will filter invalid bytes out of a byte stream request body and allow for processing of HTTP requests from the DispatcherRequestServlet.
- [ ] Filters are used with a checksum algorithm that will filter invalid bytes out of an octet stream a multipart upload and allow for chained processing of WebDispatcherServlet requests.
- [ ] Filters are used to validate request parameters out of the byte stream request body and allow for processing of requests from the DispatcherRequestServlet.

#### Explanation

A Filter is an object used to intercept the HTTP requests and responses of your application.
By using filter, we can perform two operations at two instances:
- Before sending the request to the controller;
- Before sending a response to the client.

Example of implementation of the `Filter interface`:

```java
@Component
public class SimpleFilter implements Filter {

   @Override
   public void destroy() {}

   @Override
   public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain filterchain) throws IOException, ServletException {
      
      System.out.println("Remote Host:" + request.getRemoteHost());
      System.out.println("Remote Address:" + request.getRemoteAddr());
      filterchain.doFilter(request, response);
   }

   @Override
   public void init(FilterConfig filterconfig) throws ServletException {}
}
```
#### Q2. How is a resource defined in the context of a REST service?

- [ ] A resource is the actual String literal that composes a URI that is accessed on a RESTful web service.
- [x] It is an abstract concept that represents a typed object, data, relationships, and a set of methods that operate on it that is accessed via a URI.
- [ ] A REST service has a pool of resources composed of allocations of memory that allow a request to be processed.
- [ ] A resource for a REST service is an explicit allocation of a thread or CPU cycles to allow a request to be processed.

#### Explanation
A Resource is an object with a type, associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on it.

It is similar to an object instance in an object-oriented programming language, with the important difference that only a few standard methods are defined for the resource, while an object instance typically has many methods.

#### Q3. Which of these is a valid Advice annotation?

- [ ] @AfterError
- [x] @AfterReturning
- [ ] @AfterException
- [ ] @AfterExecution

#### Explanation

Aspect-Oriented Programming complements Object-Oriented Programming by providing another way of thinking about program structure. The key unit of modularity in OOP is the class, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the aspect.

Aspects enable the modularization of concerns such as transaction management that cut across multiple types and objects.

<img src="./src/spring-framework/spring-aop-core-concept.jpg" alt="Aspect-Oriented Programming Spring" width="500"/>

Let's begin by defining some central AOP concepts and terminology:

- **Aspect** is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes.
Transaction management is a good example of a crosscutting concern in enterprise Java applications.
- **Join Point** is a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception (in Spring AOP, a join point always represents a method execution).
- **Advice** is action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Different types of advice include "around," "before" and "after" advice. Many AOP frameworks, including Spring, model an advice as an interceptor, maintaining a chain of interceptors around the join point.

Types of advice:
- **Before advice**: Advice that executes before a join point, but which does not have the ability to prevent execution flow proceeding to the join point (unless it throws an exception).
- **After returning advice**: Advice to be executed after a join point completes normally:
for example, if a method returns without throwing an exception.
- **After throwing advice**: Advice to be executed if a method exits by throwing an exception.
- **After (finally) advice**: Advice to be executed regardless of the means by which a join point exits (normal or exceptional return).
- **Around advice**: Advice that surrounds a join point such as a method invocation. This is the most powerful kind of advice. Around advice can perform custom behavior before and after the method invocation. It is also responsible for choosing whether to proceed to the join point or to shortcut the advised method execution by returning its own return value or throwing an exception.

Example: 

```java
@Component
@Aspect
public class PublishingAspect {

    private ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher;

    @Autowired
    public void setEventPublisher(ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher) {
        this.eventPublisher = eventPublisher;
    }

    @Pointcut("@target(org.springframework.stereotype.Repository)")
    public void repositoryMethods() {}

    @Pointcut("execution(* *..create*(Long,..))")
    public void firstLongParamMethods() {}

    @Pointcut("repositoryMethods() && firstLongParamMethods()")
    public void entityCreationMethods() {}

    @AfterReturning(value = "entityCreationMethods()", returning = "entity")
    public void logMethodCall(JoinPoint jp, Object entity) throws Throwable {
        eventPublisher.publishEvent(new FooCreationEvent(entity));
    }
}
```
